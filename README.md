# Presentations

This repository contains every presentation I've given either at the [Laravel Austin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Laravel-Austin/), [Austin PHP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AustinPHP/), or various conferences.

All of these presentations are written markdown and presented using [Deckset 2](https://www.decksetapp.com/2/). If you're a MacOS user, I highly recommend checking it out.

To view these presentations you can checkout my [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/hskrasek)
